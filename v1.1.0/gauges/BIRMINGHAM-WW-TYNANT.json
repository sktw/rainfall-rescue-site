is from 1950s record sheet. The 1920s record sheet states the gauge was moved in Sep 1921 to this location beside the road which fits with stated elevation. The original location is unclear, the same note says it is beside the road but the stated elevation of 1250 places the gauge 300 yards or so from the road; the original elevation might be an estimate. This suggests that the gauge may have moved upto 300 to 500 yards east in 1921 with an elevation change of up to 180 ft.","Jan and Feb results are noted as being adjusted for snow; the readings have been left in the record"],"links":{"dataFile":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ed-hawkins/rainfall-rescue/v1.1.0/DATA/BIRMINGHAM-WW-TYNANT/BIRMINGHAM-WW-TYNANT.csv","imagesFolder":"https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/13lYZ9kp28mfK2BJZ-LZ6UdTajn4lQvEJ"},"history":[{"version":"v1.0.0","location":"BIRMINGHAM-WW-TYNANT","name":"BIRMINGHAM-WW-TYNANT","changes":["New"]},{"version":"v1.1.0","location":"BIRMINGHAM-WW-TYNANT","name":"BIRMINGHAM-WW-TYNANT","changes":[]},{"version":"v2.0.0","location":"BIRMINGHAM-WW-TYNANT","name":"BIRMINGHAM-WW-TYNANT","changes":[]}]}
