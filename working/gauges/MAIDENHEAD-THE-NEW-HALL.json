Firstly the 3rd decimal place is added as a \"1/2\", which has been assumed to be 0.005. Secondly the observer uses a - for the decimal poin i.e. 2.24 is expressed 2-41 but more oddly a 0 behind in the first decimal place is expressed as a long dash, i.e 2.06 is written as 2--6. By making these interpretations the annual totals match in 5 years and differ by 0.01 and 0.005 in the other two years."],"links":{"dataFile":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ed-hawkins/rainfall-rescue/master/DATA/MAIDENHEAD-THE-NEW-HALL/MAIDENHEAD-THE-NEW-HALL.csv"},"history":[{"version":"v1.0.0","location":"MAIDENHEAD-THE-NEW-HALL","name":"MAIDENHEAD-THE-NEW-HALL","changes":["New"]},{"version":"v1.1.0","location":"MAIDENHEAD-THE-NEW-HALL","name":"MAIDENHEAD-THE-NEW-HALL","changes":[]},{"version":"working","location":"MAIDENHEAD-THE-NEW-HALL","name":"MAIDENHEAD-THE-NEW-HALL","changes":[]}]}
