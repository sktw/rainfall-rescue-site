is from the 1950s record and is the Pumping Station, as opposed to pump house, SW of the Staines reservoirs","There is a pencil note on the 1920s record suggesting that the 1920s readings might actually be for the gauge on the West Side of the reservoir. Readings left in the Pumping Station record","There are 3 gauges at this location and there are a large number of duplicated readings where that gauges overlap. The duplicated readings are randomly spread over the years and  29% to 38% of the monthly readings are within 0.04 inches of each other. 4 monthly readings are duplicated over all 3 gauges. Whilst the duplications might be suspicious, the randomness of their occurrence and the closeness of the readings across all gauges suggests the readings are generally legitimate."],"links":{"dataFile":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ed-hawkins/rainfall-rescue/v1.0.0/DATA/STAINES-RESERVOIRS/STAINES-RESERVOIRS.csv"},"history":[{"version":"v1.0.0","name":"STAINES-RESERVOIRS","location":"STAINES-RESERVOIRS","changes":["New"]}]}
