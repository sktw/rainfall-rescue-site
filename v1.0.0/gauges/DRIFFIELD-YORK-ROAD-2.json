contradictory about whether the gauge is in [Great] Driffield or Little Driffield.","The sheet titles all refer to Driffield York Road, and the census gives 3 York Road as the observer address.","With York Road being in Driffield rather than Little Driffield.","But the church directions on the sheet mention Little Driffield church explicitly, and so put the gauge on the eastern edge of Little Driffield.","Grid references for the two locations are: TA020581 (York Road) and TA012580 (Little Driffield), about 1km to the west.","Based on the directions, the Little Driffield site rather than the observer's address is assumed to be where the gauge was located, and its grid reference has been used.","The readings for January-April 1895 are duplicated on the 1890s sheet for Driffield Highfield.","1895 was the first year of operation for Driffield Highfield.","The duplicated values seem likely to belong to Little Driffield and been borrowed by Driffield Highfield to produce a full year total.","And so the duplicated values have been retained
